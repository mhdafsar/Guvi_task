# Guvi_task

The task is to create a register page , login page and a profile page.






Successful login should redirect to a profile page which should contain additional details such as age, dob, contact, etc. The user can update his/her profile page.





Condition:


Flow : Register > Login > Profile




● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the
codes must co-exist in the same file.





● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage
of form submission).





● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to
maintain page responsiveness.





● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the
details of the user profiles




● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL
statements.




● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage
(Do not use PHP Session)




● Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.




● Either host it in Netlify or share us your GITHUB project link.



These are all the conditions I apply for this task.


Note:

I've satisfied almost all the condition ,but I've not practiced 'Redis' and Mongo DB,because I need some time to learn for that, but definitely I can learn that technology in future.
